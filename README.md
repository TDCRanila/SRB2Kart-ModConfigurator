# SRB2Kart - Mod Configurator / Launcher

### Project

This project is a launcher / mod configurator for [SRB2Kart by Kart Krew](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/srb2kart.25868/).

The launcher has mainly been made to better manage your mods or modpacks, but it also exposes several [commandline parameter](https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Command_line_parameters) used to override some game settings in a neater UI friendly way. The user can then save this configuration to be used later. The user can use the config to launch the game with those mods and settings from launcher or they can export it to a batch file.

The main goal was to make this project for SRB2Kart, however, this can probably also be used for the base SRB2 game, but I haven't tested that. 

#### Disclaimer

I don't write much a whole lot of C#/Visual Forms code, so excuse any mistakes here and there.
