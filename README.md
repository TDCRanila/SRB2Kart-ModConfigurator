# SRB2Kart-ModConfigurator

This project is a launcher / mod configurator for [SRB2Kart by Kart Krew](https://mb.srb2.org/threads/srb2kart.25868/).

The launcher has mainly been made to better manage your mods or modpacks, but it also exposes several [commandline parameter](https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Command_line_parameters) used to override some game settings in a neater UI friendly way. The user can then save this configuration to be used later. The user can use the config to launch the game with those mods and settings from launcher or they can export it to a batch file.

The launcher could probably also be used by the base SRB2 game, but I haven't tested that. The main goal was to make it for SRB2Kart.
